# Classification


Introduction

In this project, you will design three classifiers: a perceptron classifier, a large-margin (MIRA) classifier, and a slightly modified perceptron classifier for behavioral cloning. You will test the first two classifiers on a set of scanned handwritten digit images, and the last on sets of recorded pacman games from various agents. Even with simple features, your classifiers will be able to do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the task of extracting text from image sources. The data set on which you will run your classifiers is a collection of handwritten numerical digits (0-9). This is a very commercially useful technology, similar to the technique used by the US post office to route mail by zip codes. There are systems that can perform with over 99% classification accuracy (see LeNet-5 for an example system in action).

Behavioral cloning is the task of learning to copy a behavior simply by observing examples of that behavior. In this project, you will be using this idea to mimic various pacman agents by using recorded games as training examples. Your agent will then run the classifier at each action in order to try and determine which action would be taken by the observed agent.

The code for this project includes the following files and data, available as a zip file.

Data file
data.zip	Data file, including the digit and face data.

Files you will edit
naiveBayes.py	The location where you will write your naive Bayes classifier.
perceptron.py	The location where you will write your perceptron classifier.
mira.py	The location where you will write your MIRA classifier.
dataClassifier.py	The wrapper code that will call your classifiers. You will also write your enhanced feature extractor here. You will also use this code to analyze the behavior of your classifier.
answers.py	Answer to Question 2 goes here.


Files you should read but NOT edit
classificationMethod.py	Abstract super class for the classifiers you will write. 
(You should read this file carefully to see how the infrastructure is set up.)
samples.py	I/O code to read in the classification data.
util.py	Code defining some useful tools. You may be familiar with some of these by now, and they will save you a lot of time.
mostFrequent.py	A simple baseline classifier that just labels every instance as the most frequent class.

Files to Edit and Submit: You will fill in portions of perceptron.py, mira.py, answers.py,perceptron_pacman.py, and dataClassifier.py (only) during the assignment, and submit them. You should submit these files with your code and comments. Please do not change the other files in this distribution or submit any of our original files other than this file.

Evaluation: Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please do not change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's judgements -- will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.
